What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git starts keeping metadata on changes in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

While the workspace physiaclly holds the files in our project, the staging area keeps
info about changes that have been made to these files. This tracking info is stored 
along with the project files when a commit is made. Making a commit creates a copy of 
the project files and tracking info in the repo.
