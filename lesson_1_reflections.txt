How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    In that way, it's easier to go back to a version with certain needed information.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    A major advantage is that the code is updated only after a complete logical
    element has been modified. The major disadvantage is that useful work can be
    lost if the coding environment is accidentally shut down.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
